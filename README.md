# grpc-proto

Pratice to user a maven project to build jar from protobuf definition file

1. .protos are located at src/main/proto which is the default location for protobuf-maven-plugin
2. mvn install will generate .jar which include all built classes


TODO:
1. Is it possible to specify different package for each class?
2. Even separate to different jar?
